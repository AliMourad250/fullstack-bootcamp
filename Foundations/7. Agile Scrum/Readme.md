## Agile

Agile is an iterative and collaborative approach to project management that emphasizes flexibility, adaptability, and customer satisfaction. It focuses on delivering incremental value through short development cycles called sprints. Agile methodologies promote a mindset shift that values individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.

Key aspects of Agile include:

- **Iterative and Incremental Development:** Agile projects break down the work into small, manageable increments, allowing for frequent iterations and feedback loops.
- **Collaboration and Communication:** Agile methodologies prioritize frequent and open communication within the team and with stakeholders, fostering collaboration and alignment.
- **Customer Involvement:** Agile promotes active customer involvement throughout the development process, allowing for continuous feedback and course correction.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Agile teams embrace change and are responsive to evolving requirements, market conditions, and customer needs.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Agile encourages a culture of continuous learning, adaptation, and improvement through regular retrospectives and feedback loops.

## Scrum

Scrum is a popular Agile framework for managing complex projects. It provides a structured approach to guide teams in delivering value iteratively and incrementally. Scrum divides the work into time-boxed iterations called sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. The framework consists of specific roles, artifacts, and ceremonies.

Key elements of Scrum include:

- **Roles:**
  - **Product Owner:** Represents the stakeholders, manages the product backlog, and ensures the team builds the right product.
  - **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and helps the team work effectively.
  - **Development Team:** Self-organizing and cross-functional, responsible for delivering the product increment.

- **Artifacts:**
  - **Product Backlog:** A prioritized list of features, user stories, or tasks that need to be completed.
  - **Sprint Backlog:** The subset of the product backlog items selected for the current sprint.
  - **Increment:** The sum of all completed product backlog items at the end of each sprint.

- **Ceremonies:**
  - **Sprint Planning:** The team plans the work for the upcoming sprint, selects backlog items, and creates a sprint goal.
  - **Daily Scrum:** A short daily meeting where team members share progress, discuss challenges, and plan their work for the day.
  - **Sprint Review:** The team presents the completed work to stakeholders and collects feedback for the next sprint.
  - **Sprint Retrospective:** The team reflects on the previous sprint, identifies areas for improvement, and plans changes for the next sprint.

Scrum provides a framework that promotes transparency, inspection, and adaptation. It helps teams to collaborate, deliver value iteratively, and continuously improve their processes.

## Exercise: Agile Project Management with Trello

**Objective:** To simulate an Agile project using the Scrum framework and Trello as the project management tool.

**Materials Needed:**
- Trello board (online or physical board with sticky notes)
- Sticky notes or index cards
- Writing utensils

**Instructions:**

1. Divide the students into small groups (ideally 4-6 members per group).

2. Define the project: Choose a simple project or task that the groups will work on throughout the exercise. For example, building a website, organizing an event, or creating a marketing campaign.

3. Set up a Trello board: Create a Trello board for each group, representing the project's workflow. Use the following lists: "Backlog," "To Do," "In Progress," "Testing," and "Done."

4. Create user stories: Each group should brainstorm and create user stories that represent the project requirements and tasks. Write each user story on a sticky note or index card.

5. Backlog prioritization: As a group, prioritize the user stories by their importance or value to the project. Use the MoSCoW prioritization technique (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) to categorize the stories accordingly.

6. Sprint planning:
   - Determine the duration of the sprint (e.g., 1-2 weeks).
   - Select user stories from the prioritized backlog and move them to the "To Do" list on the Trello board, representing the sprint backlog.

7. Sprint execution:
   - Each group member should choose a user story from the "To Do" list and move it to the "In Progress" list on the Trello board.
   - As they work on their tasks, they should update the status on Trello and move the cards accordingly (e.g., "In Progress" to "Testing" and then to "Done").

8. Daily Stand-up:
   - Conduct a daily stand-up meeting within each group, where each member briefly shares their progress, any obstacles they encountered, and their plans for the day.
   - Encourage the use of Trello during the stand-up to refer to the project board and update their tasks accordingly.

9. Sprint Review:
   - At the end of the sprint, each group presents their completed work to the class or other groups, showcasing the user stories that have been moved to the "Done" list.
   - Collect feedback and suggestions from other groups or stakeholders.

10. Sprint Retrospective:
    - Facilitate a retrospective discussion within each group, reflecting on the sprint and discussing what went well, what could be improved, and any lessons learned.
    - Encourage the use of Trello to capture retrospective action items and improvements for future sprints.

Throughout the exercise, emphasize the Agile principles of collaboration, self-organization, and iterative development. Encourage students to actively use Trello as their project management tool, updating tasks, adding comments, and collaborating with their team members.

By engaging in this exercise, students will have hands-on experience with Agile practices, learn how to manage a project using Scrum, and become familiar with the features and functionalities of Trello as an Agile project management tool.
