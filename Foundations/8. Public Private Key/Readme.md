Public and private keys are an important part of cryptography, which is a way to secure communication and protect sensitive information. In simple terms, they are used to ensure that only the intended recipient can read or access certain data.

Here's how it works:

- **Public Key**: A public key is like a lock that everyone can see. It's used to encrypt data or messages that you want to send to someone else. You can share your public key with anyone, and they can use it to encrypt information that only you can decrypt.

- **Private Key**: A private key is like the corresponding key to the lock mentioned above. It's kept secret and known only to you. You use your private key to decrypt the information that was encrypted using your public key. The private key should never be shared with anyone else.

When it comes to using GitHub in the terminal, the concept of public and private keys is used for secure authentication. Instead of relying on passwords, GitHub uses a method called SSH (Secure Shell) to establish a secure connection between your computer and the GitHub server.

Here's how it works in GitHub for the terminal:

1. **Generating Keys**: First, you need to generate a pair of public and private keys on your computer. This is done using a tool called `ssh-keygen`. The private key is stored on your computer, while the public key is uploaded to your GitHub account.

2. **Linking Keys**: After generating the keys, you need to link the public key to your GitHub account. This allows GitHub to recognize your computer when you try to access it through the terminal.

3. **Authentication**: When you try to perform actions like cloning a repository or pushing changes to GitHub, your computer uses your private key to prove that it is you. GitHub checks the public key stored in your account to verify your identity. If the keys match, the connection is authenticated, and you are allowed to proceed with the requested action.

In summary, public and private keys are used in GitHub's SSH authentication process to establish a secure connection between your computer and GitHub's servers, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify the repositories.
